      <h2>My Stories</h2>
      <p>Okay, full disclosure—this is where things get a little cringey. But hey, we’ve all been there.<br>
        <br>
        Back in 2018, I was wrestling with a lot of emotions, and my genius strategy was to shut them down 
        until they… disappeared? (Spoiler: That didn’t work. Shocking, I know.)<br><br>

        Somehow, in all that chaos, I stumbled onto writing as a way to make sense of things. But I didn’t 
        write about my problems directly—instead, I wrote about the things I loved, the moments that stuck 
        with me, the thoughts that wouldn’t let go. Some of these turned into absurdly long rambles (how did 
        I even have the time?), but looking back, they mattered. They were tiny anchors in the storm.<br><br>

        And then, of course, there was him. Did I write because I’d finally found a way to process things? Or
        because I’d found a muse worth preserving? I still don’t know. But that’s a question for another poem.<br><br>
