      <p>What do I know about love? Grief? Jealousy? Like so much in this world—not enough. (Or maybe just enough to know I want to learn more.)<br><br>
        There’s something extraordinary about the way words can give shape to feelings we don’t even fully understand. Imagine being loved
        so deeply that someone had to write about it. (Or is it the other way around? Does writing about it make the love deeper?) 
        Imagine crafting sentences that cut sharper than a blade or bloom softer than a bruise. Poetry exists in a realm where language bends 
        reality—where words become weapons, yes, but not for destruction. They’re weapons of witness. A single line can pull you into a story More actions
        you’ve never lived, make you ache with a borrowed sorrow, or glow with secondhand joy. Maybe one day you’ll feel it for yourself. 
        (Or maybe—in retrospect—you’ll hope you never do.)<br><br>

        That’s the truth of life, isn’t it? And that’s the power of a mind with a pen: to carve the intangible into something you can hold.<br>
