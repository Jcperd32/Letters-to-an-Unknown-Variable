      <h2>Math</h2>
      <p>
          I wasn’t going to add this section—I already knew what people would say. "I could never do math," 
          "I hate math," or "So, what’s two plus two?" Those comments lost their grace long ago. It doesn’t bother me; it’s just predictable.<br><br>

        But I’m here to tell you why math matters. For me, its importance was always obvious—I never needed an explanation. 
          But the world doesn’t work that way. I don’t understand the appeal of, say, American football, but that’s irrelevant—not 
          everything is meant to cater to me. People love different things, and that’s what’s led us here.<br><br>
        
        A good debate is built on structure. It leaves no room for doubt. It doesn’t need emotion because a foundation of fundamental, 
          universal truth dismantles any counterargument. So, what is math?<br><br>
        
        Math is the language of the universe. It’s fundamentally true in every corner of existence (if corners even exist). It can never 
          be wrong—you might calculate incorrectly, but its laws remain unshaken. There’s a debate in mathematics: Is math created or discovered? 
          I believe it’s discovered. We merely use our symbols—numbers, equations—to describe something intrinsic to reality. Roman numerals could do the same, though less efficiently.<br><br>
        
        No other science is 100% universally true. Even the laws of physics break down inside a black hole. Yet, Einstein’s math predicted 
          black holes before we observed them. For decades, they were just equations on paper—until we found them. Imagine something so structurally 
          complete that it reveals the unseen. That’s why math is beautiful.<br><br>
        
        This page follows a pattern—it’s about imagination, visualizing the intangible through words. But of all languages, math is the most 
          precious. Close your eyes, and you’re in an abstract world where everything obeys its laws. No errors. You can exist in a million 
          dimensions, calculating precise numbers, while our physical world limits us to three (or four, counting time).<br><br>
        
        All sciences follow math’s rules, yet math alone can redefine their foundations. Consider Newton and Leibniz discovering calculus
          independently—how could that be mere creation and not discovery?<br><br>
        
        There must be math to solve everything. Even this moment—what’s the probability we’d meet here? How long did our particles travel, 
          remnants of dead stars, to form the gold in your heart? Gold is forged in the collision of neutron stars, a force so violent it 
          shakes the cosmos. From that chaos, you were born. You crossed billions of light-years to Earth, letting me feel the universe’s power.<br><br>
        
        So here’s my tribute to the language that taught me the universe doesn’t owe us meaning—we uncover it, equation by equation.<br>
