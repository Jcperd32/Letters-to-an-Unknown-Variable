      <h2>Movies</h2>
      <p>
        Not everyone has two hours to spare for a movie. Some drag; some fly. 
        But one thing I know: ratings lie. For me, films were either alive or 
        dead—no in-between. Loved ones all ranked the same, even if I obsessed 
        over some more than others. Maybe that’s hypocrisy. Maybe just laziness 
        to dissect why they’re different.<br><br>
        Watching with someone else, though? That’s where the magic twists. You tear apart 
        scenes like critics, even if you couldn’t do better. (Let’s be real: most of us 
        just enjoy the act of judging.) And when it’s your favorite film? You pray they 
        catch the same details that gutted you—no rewinds allowed. Their reaction becomes 
        part of the story.<br><br>
        But here’s what I never solved: how you processed movies. We’d debate them, agree, 
        disagree, disagree just to agree harder. Yet I always sensed something hidden—a subtext
        I couldn’t decode. Was it really there, or was I projecting scenes onto you like bad 
        subtitles? I tried, like all movie heroes, but my third act never arrived.<br><br>
        Sometimes I still wonder if the film’s rolling. If I’m stuck in the climax,
        waiting for a resolution that’s already passed me by--or were you watching alone?
