      <h2>People that shaped me</h2>
      <p>
        When you think about the people who shaped who you are—who comes to mind? For me, 
        there are too many to count. (And honestly, too many to fit here without this turning 
        into a novel no one asked for.)<br><br>

        So I'll stick to the cultural and historical figures—the ones whose qualities I want 
        to steal like a literary magpie. Because in some ways, it's not just about who shaped 
        me, but who I want to shape myself into. Their best parts, at least.<br><br>

        This is my way of pushing toward being better: collecting traits like shiny objects.
        Wisdom from one, courage from another, that particular way of seeing the world from someone else.<br><br>

        (Though I should mention—there was this one conversation by the Hudson that stuck with me. 
        Someone said, "I strive to be the best version of me, I prefer not to compete with others." 
        And I thought—what kind of beautiful nonsense is that? But then again... you were the best 
        person I knew. So maybe there's something to it.)<br><br>

    <div class="subintro"> 
      <h2>Erased</h2>
      <p>I decided to separate this into themes, for clarity or maybe just for my own sanity. The first? Erased.<br>
          These are the people who deserved monuments but got footnotes. Geniuses who pushed science and math forward, 
        only to have their work stolen, diminished, or cut short before they could reach their full height. 
        What they left behind, precision, rigor, wonder, are things I wish I could carry in my own bones.<br>
        It took me forever to pinpoint exactly what quality each of them represents. I hope I did them justice. 
        Because this isn't just about giving credit where it's overdue (though it is). It's about asking: What 
        could they have become? And what does it say about us, that we let them disappear?

        <h3>Rosalind Franklin - Precision</h3>
        <p class="quote">"Science and Everyday life cannot and should not be separated"</p>
        <p>I first learned about her in chemistry class. What a perfectionist. 
          The documentary we watched is fuzzy now, but not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_51">Photo 51</a>,that sharp X-ray 
          diffraction image of DNA, crisp as a starched lab coat. It wasn’t just a pretty
          pattern; it was the key to the double helix, to mapping heredity, to tracing diseases 
          like a detective follows fingerprints. All because she knew how to align crystals just so, 
          to wait for the perfect exposure, to reject blurry data like noise.<br><br>
          Yet two men (names omitted, as they’re not the point) took her data, her clarity, 
          and won a Nobel Prize. She demanded credit and got silence. Imagine dedicating years to work that precise, only to watch someone
          else claim the breakthrough. Still, she kept working: tobacco mosaic virus, polio virus, 
          structures mapped atom by atom. No bitterness, just another sample, another experiment. 
          That’s the work ethic I want to steal—the kind that treats a snub like a misaligned lens: 
          recalibrate, try again.<br><br>
          She died at 37, radiation exposure etching its price into her cells. What more could she 
          have uncovered? Precision isn’t just for labs; it’s a moral stance. The world should reward 
          rigor like hers, because work that exacting deserves more than a footnote. It deserves to be 
          etched in stone.</p>

        <h3>Chien-Shiung Wu - Rigor</h3>
        <p class="quote">"I wonder whether the tiny atoms and nuclei, or the mathematical symbols, or 
          the DNA molecules have any preference for either masculine or feminine treatment."</p>
        <p>
          If you’ve ever wondered why the universe exists at all(not literally, but our understanding), you might want to thank her. Decades ago, 
          everyone believed the universe followed perfect symmetry—that matter and antimatter should cancel 
          each other out, leaving nothing behind. But if that were true, none of us would be here.<br><br>
          Then came Wu. She proved that some particles in atoms prefer to spin left, breaking this supposed law of 
          symmetry. It changed everything. Her work paved the way for nuclear medicine (like cancer treatments) 
          and quantum computing (which I still don’t fully understand, because quantum entanglement might as well be magic).<br><br>
          But here’s the bitter part: the Nobel Prize went to the men who had the idea for the experiment, not to her, 
          the one who proved it. Like so many women in science, her rigor was rewarded with silence. She never complained 
          outright, but if you read her quotes, you’ll catch the quiet frustration.<br><br>
          And that’s why I call this rigor. At the time (and let’s be honest, still today), 
          women were seen as assistants, not pioneers. But her work was so precise, so undeniable, 
          it left no room for debate. She drilled into her students the same discipline: Triple-check 
          everything. Because the world will scrutinize your work twice as hard.<br><br>
          I hope one day I’ll have even a fraction of her rigor. Not her grace, though—I don’t think I could swallow that injustice so quietly.

        <h3>Maryam Mirzakhani - Wonder</h3>
        <p class="quote">"I don't give up easily."</p>
        <p>
        Topology still messes with my head. How can a donut and a coffee mug be the same thing? The math 
          proves it, but my brain refuses to accept it. That's where Maryam was different - she didn't
          just solve these problems, she turned them into art.<br><br>
          While most mathematicians follow cold logic, Maryam would sprawl on the floor, drawing shapes 
          and curves like a child lost in imagination. Her doodles weren't idle sketches - they revealed 
          how surfaces behave in dimensions most of us can't even visualize. That playful wonder led to 
          breakthroughs men couldn't achieve through rigid thinking alone.<br><br>
          In mathematics, we don't have a Nobel Prize. We have the Fields Medal - and Maryam remains 
          the only woman to ever receive it. She earned it by approaching problems sideways, through 
          curiosity rather than force.<br><br>
          It stings that I never learned about her in class. Not when her work connects to everything 
          from quantum physics to how the universe folds. Even more, it stings that she died at 40 - 
          what else might she have uncovered?<br><br>
          My math classes told their own story: maybe one or two women against thirty men. Yet somehow, 
          those women were always near the top. I don't know what that says about math, but I know what
          it says about the world. Maryam proved wonder isn't just for daydreamers - it's the sharpest tool we have.

      <h2>Defiance</h2>
      <p>
        If you're here thinking "this guy only highlights women"—hold up. 
        Truth is, oppression doesn't care about gender, and neither do I. 
        This section's got two men and one woman because defiance isn't about
        chromosomes. It's about people who saw fucked-up systems and said "nah."<br><br>
        I won't pretend these three labels—stealth, rebellion, vision—fully capture 
        them (you'll see why the categories blur). But stick around. There's a 
        method to this, and yeah, I'm kinda proud of how these pieces fit together.<br><br>
        (And if you're still hung up on the "men vs. women" thing? Maybe ask why that's your 
        first question when we're talking about human courage.)
