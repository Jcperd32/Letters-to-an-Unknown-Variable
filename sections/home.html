      <h1>About this page</h1>
      <p>Like most things in this world, there must be a reason for this page to exist—right? 
        Why else would I spend months on it? Well, there is a reason, but... let's just say 
        this margin isn't big enough to contain it. (iykyk.)<br><br>

        Truth is, I started this project years ago. Three, to be exact. And yet here I am, 
        still procrastinating, still building another page—anything to delay the inevitable. 
        At first, I wasn't sure what to put here. Make it a game? Nah, that didn't feel right. 
        Then it hit me: Create something to remind me. Because isn't it sad how we forget? Not 
        just the things themselves, but why they mattered in the first place?<br><br>

        Not that this is anything too personal. Those things stay locked away—literally or 
        metaphorically, who knows? I'll probably forget by morning. And yet... this keeps 
        resurfacing in my mind, over and over.<br>

    <h2>The Obsession With Reading People</h2><br>
    <p>   Am I rambling? Maybe. But here's what fascinates me: the ability to truly read someone. 
          To understand another person—a whole separate universe of thoughts and behaviors—isn't 
          that wild? Psychology has its models, its predictions, but none of them are foolproof. 
          Most people fit expectations, but outliers exist—and human behavior has too many 
          variables to ever fully map.. And really, how much of our "insight" is just 
          confirmation bias telling us we're better at this than we actually are?<br><br>

          Yet... some people are unnaturally good at it. Have you ever met someone like that? Someone 
          who swallows you whole—an ocean where the water is their understanding, their kindness, every 
          good thing you didn't think could exist in one person? I don't have to imagine. I know.<br><br>

          I barely speak. I barely let people in. Nothing I do would ever give me away. And yet... you 
          saw everything. Every hidden nuance, every quiet obsession. Were you made for me? Or for the world?<br><br>

          Taoism says balance is inevitable—yin and yang, good and bad. But with all the suffering out 
          there, it never felt that way. Until you. You made me believe the world could be better. 
          (And also that I wasn't doing enough. Thanks for that, hypocrite me. Hah.)<br><br>

          Is there a point to all this? Yes. But it's not obvious—not at first, maybe not even the second time. But it's there.<br><br>

          You'll see(Or maybe you won't. Some doors only open if you're willing to jiggle the handle.)<br><br>
