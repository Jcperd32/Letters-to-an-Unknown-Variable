      <h1>About this page</h1>
      <p>
        Like most things in this world, there must be a reason for this page to exist—right? 
        Why else would I spend months on it? Well, there is a reason, but... let’s just say 
        this margin isn’t big enough to contain it. (iykyk.)<br><br>

        Truth is, I was supposed to be working on something else. Something bigger. 
        Three years ago, I called it a "project"—capital P, like it deserved a spotlight. 
        But here’s the funny thing about Projects: the closer you get to finishing them, 
        the more they terrify you. So I did what any self-respecting coward would do. I 
        built this instead.<br><br>

        At first, I wasn’t sure what to put here. A game? Too clever by half. A library? 
        Too static, too final. Then it hit me: this could be a trapdoor. A way to fall 
        into the things I almost forgot—or the things I can’t stop remembering.<br><br>

        Not that this is anything too personal. Those things stay locked away—literally 
        or metaphorically, who knows? I’ll probably forget by morning. And yet... this
        keeps resurfacing in my mind, over and over.<br>

    <h2>The Obsession With Reading People</h2><br>
    <p>   Am I rambling? Maybe. But here's what fascinates me: the ability to truly read someone. 
          To understand another person—a whole separate universe of thoughts and behaviors—isn't 
          that wild? Psychology has its models, its predictions, but none of them are foolproof. 
          Most people fit expectations, but outliers exist—and human behavior has too many 
          variables to ever fully map.<br><br>
          
          And really, how much of our "insight" is just 
          confirmation bias telling us we're better at this than we actually are?<br><br>

          Yet... some people are unnaturally good at it. Have you ever met someone like that? Someone 
          who swallows you whole—an ocean where the water is their understanding, their kindness, every 
          good thing you didn't think could exist in one person? I don't have to imagine. I know.<br><br>

          I barely speak. I barely let people in. Nothing I do would ever give me away. And yet... you 
          saw everything. Every hidden nuance, every quiet obsession. Were you made for me? Or for the world?<br><br>

          Taoism says balance is inevitable—yin and yang, good and bad. But with all the suffering out 
          there, it never felt that way. Until you. You made me believe the world could be better. 
          (And also that I wasn't doing enough. Thanks for that, hypocrite me. Hah.)<br><br>

          Is there a point to all this? Yes. But it's not obvious—not at first, maybe not even the second time. But it's there.<br><br>

          You'll see(Or maybe you won't. Some doors only open if you're willing to jiggle the handle.)<br><br>

    <h2>On Being a Person (And the Ones Who Weren’t)</h2><br>
    <p>
      Most people are echoes. We repeat what we hear, love what 
      we’re told to love, fear what’s already marked as frightening. 
      We move through life in familiar patterns—some hoping to leave a 
      mark, others just humming along. Even then, we’re still echoes. 
      But that’s not necessarily bad. Think of music: every possible 
      chord has been played, yet rearrange the frequency, the tempo, 
      the silence between the notes, and suddenly it’s new again.<br><br>

      But who taught us to play? Or is this the part where someone 
      whispers simulation theory—where we’re all NPCs in a song that’s 
      already written, waiting for the final measure to hit? (Who composed 
      this? I have theories, but they’re not the point.)<br><br>

      The point is the anomalies.<br><br>

    <h2>Anatomy of an Anomaly</h2><br>
    <p>
      Anomalies don’t just break rules; they expose them. These creatures—yes, 
      creatures; what else do you call something so unbound?—aren’t tethered 
      to our expectations. They move freely, and their very existence leaves 
      cracks in the glass wall between how things are and how they could be.<br><br>

      But how do you spot one? They still cry. They still laugh. They feel and 
      touch like anyone else. The difference is in the aftermath: that lingering 
      sense that your brain can’t file them away. Who are you? you’ll wonder. 
      Who made you? No logic fits. No model predicts them.<br><br>

      Have you ever met one? A person so themselves it almost hurts? Or are you 
      still mistaking the map for the territory?<br><br>

      (The map is not the territory. A lesson I learned too late: we spend our 
      lives staring at labels—mother, genius, martyr, thief—and forget they’re 
      just scribbles on paper. The territory is the thing itself: the jagged, 
      breathing mess of a person no word could ever contain.)
