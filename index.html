        <h1>About this page</h1>
        <p>Like most things in this world, there must be a reason for this page to exist—right? 
          Why else would I spend months on it? Well, there is a reason, but... let’s just say 
          this margin isn’t big enough to contain it. (iykyk.)<br><br>

          Truth is, I started this project years ago. Three, to be exact. And yet here I am, 
          still procrastinating, still building another page—anything to delay the inevitable. 
          At first, I wasn’t sure what to put here. Make it a game? Nah, that didn’t feel right. 
          Then it hit me: Create something to remind me. Because isn’t it sad how we forget? Not 
          just the things themselves, but why they mattered in the first place?<br><br>

          Not that this is anything too personal. Those things stay locked away—literally or 
          metaphorically, who knows? I’ll probably forget by morning. And yet... this keeps 
          resurfacing in my mind, over and over.<br>

      <h2>The Obsession With Reading People</h2><br>
      <p>   Am I rambling? Maybe. But here’s what fascinates me: the ability to truly read someone. 
            To understand another person—a whole separate universe of thoughts and behaviors—isn’t 
            that wild? Psychology has its models, its predictions, but none of them are foolproof. 
            Most people fit expectations, but outliers exist—and human behavior has too many 
            variables to ever fully map.. And really, how much of our "insight" is just 
            confirmation bias telling us we’re better at this than we actually are?<br><br>

            Yet... some people are unnaturally good at it. Have you ever met someone like that? Someone 
            who swallows you whole—an ocean where the water is their understanding, their kindness, every 
            good thing you didn’t think could exist in one person? I don’t have to imagine. I know.<br><br>

            I barely speak. I barely let people in. Nothing I do would ever give me away. And yet... you 
            saw everything. Every hidden nuance, every quiet obsession. Were you made for me? Or for the world?<br><br>

            Taoism says balance is inevitable—yin and yang, good and bad. But with all the suffering out 
            there, it never felt that way. Until you. You made me believe the world could be better. 
            (And also that I wasn’t doing enough. Thanks for that, hypocrite me. Hah.)<br><br>

            Is there a point to all this? Yes. But it’s not obvious—not at first, maybe not even the second time. But it’s there.<br><br>

            You’ll see(Or maybe you won’t. Some doors only open if you’re willing to jiggle the handle.)<br><br>

      <h2>Book Recommendations</h2>
      <p>Not sure if anyone else will find these as fascinating as I did, but here are some books I’ve thoroughly enjoyed. 
        To keep things light (and because I get that not everyone loves a dense math book), I’ve left out the super technical 
        reads—but there’s still plenty of fun and insight here.
      </p>
      <p>To me, a book is like an invitation into someone’s mind. Writing is really about how the author feels and how they 
        choose to express those feelings. And that’s the fascinating part—trying to piece together how a person works. You can 
        learn a lot by observing how someone behaves, treats others, or even what they love and hate. But reading their thoughts?
        That’s where the real mystery unfolds.
      </p>
      <p>You get glimpses of their lessons, regrets, dreams—sometimes it even feels like they’re writing about you. Some books make 
        you nod along in sympathy; others feel like you could’ve written them yourself. And in the process, you end up learning just 
        as much about yourself as you do about the author.

      <h2>People that shaped me</h2>
      <p>
        When you think about the people who shaped who you are—who comes to mind? For me, 
        there are too many to count. (And honestly, too many to fit here without this turning 
        into a novel no one asked for.)<br><br>

        So I'll stick to the cultural and historical figures—the ones whose qualities I want 
        to steal like a literary magpie. Because in some ways, it's not just about who shaped 
        me, but who I want to shape myself into. Their best parts, at least.<br><br>

        This is my way of pushing toward being better: collecting traits like shiny objects.
        Wisdom from one, courage from another, that particular way of seeing the world from someone else.<br><br>

        (Though I should mention—there was this one conversation by the Hudson that stuck with me. 
        Someone said, "I strive to be the best version of me, I prefer not to compete with others." 
        And I thought—what kind of beautiful nonsense is that? But then again... you were the best 
        person I knew. So maybe there's something to it.)<br><br>
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- This will be for the first theme: Erased-->
    <div class="subintro"> 
      <h2>Erased</h2>
      <p>I decided to separate this into themes, for clarity or maybe just for my own sanity. The first? Erased.<br>
          These are the people who deserved monuments but got footnotes. Geniuses who pushed science and math forward, 
        only to have their work stolen, diminished, or cut short before they could reach their full height. 
        What they left behind, precision, rigor, wonder, are things I wish I could carry in my own bones.<br>
        It took me forever to pinpoint exactly what quality each of them represents. I hope I did them justice. 
        Because this isn't just about giving credit where it's overdue (though it is). It's about asking: What 
        could they have become? And what does it say about us, that we let them disappear?
      </p>

        <h3>Rosalind Franklin - Precision</h3>
        <p class="quote">"Science and Everyday life cannot and should not be separated"</p>
        <p>I first learned about her in chemistry class. What a perfectionist. 
          The documentary we watched is fuzzy now, but not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_51">Photo 51</a>,that sharp X-ray 
          diffraction image of DNA, crisp as a starched lab coat. It wasn’t just a pretty
          pattern; it was the key to the double helix, to mapping heredity, to tracing diseases 
          like a detective follows fingerprints. All because she knew how to align crystals just so, 
          to wait for the perfect exposure, to reject blurry data like noise.<br><br>
          Yet two men (names omitted, as they’re not the point) took her data, her clarity, 
          and won a Nobel Prize. She demanded credit and got silence. Imagine dedicating years to work that precise, only to watch someone
          else claim the breakthrough. Still, she kept working: tobacco mosaic virus, polio virus, 
          structures mapped atom by atom. No bitterness, just another sample, another experiment. 
          That’s the work ethic I want to steal—the kind that treats a snub like a misaligned lens: 
          recalibrate, try again.<br><br>
          She died at 37, radiation exposure etching its price into her cells. What more could she 
          have uncovered? Precision isn’t just for labs; it’s a moral stance. The world should reward 
          rigor like hers, because work that exacting deserves more than a footnote. It deserves to be 
          etched in stone.</p>

        <h3>Chien-Shiung Wu - Rigor</h3>
        <p class="quote">"I wonder whether the tiny atoms and nuclei, or the mathematical symbols, or 
          the DNA molecules have any preference for either masculine or feminine treatment."</p>
        <p>
          If you’ve ever wondered why the universe exists at all(not literally, but our understanding), you might want to thank her. Decades ago, 
          everyone believed the universe followed perfect symmetry—that matter and antimatter should cancel 
          each other out, leaving nothing behind. But if that were true, none of us would be here.<br><br>
          Then came Wu. She proved that some particles in atoms prefer to spin left, breaking this supposed law of 
          symmetry. It changed everything. Her work paved the way for nuclear medicine (like cancer treatments) 
          and quantum computing (which I still don’t fully understand, because quantum entanglement might as well be magic).<br><br>
          But here’s the bitter part: the Nobel Prize went to the men who had the idea for the experiment, not to her, 
          the one who proved it. Like so many women in science, her rigor was rewarded with silence. She never complained 
          outright, but if you read her quotes, you’ll catch the quiet frustration.<br><br>
          And that’s why I call this rigor. At the time (and let’s be honest, still today), 
          women were seen as assistants, not pioneers. But her work was so precise, so undeniable, 
          it left no room for debate. She drilled into her students the same discipline: Triple-check 
          everything. Because the world will scrutinize your work twice as hard.<br><br>
          I hope one day I’ll have even a fraction of her rigor. Not her grace, though—I don’t think I could swallow that injustice so quietly.

        <h3>Maryam Mirzakhani - Wonder</h3>
        <p class="quote">"I don't give up easily."</p>
        <p>
        Topology still messes with my head. How can a donut and a coffee mug be the same thing? The math 
          proves it, but my brain refuses to accept it. That's where Maryam was different - she didn't
          just solve these problems, she turned them into art.<br><br>
          While most mathematicians follow cold logic, Maryam would sprawl on the floor, drawing shapes 
          and curves like a child lost in imagination. Her doodles weren't idle sketches - they revealed 
          how surfaces behave in dimensions most of us can't even visualize. That playful wonder led to 
          breakthroughs men couldn't achieve through rigid thinking alone.<br><br>
          In mathematics, we don't have a Nobel Prize. We have the Fields Medal - and Maryam remains 
          the only woman to ever receive it. She earned it by approaching problems sideways, through 
          curiosity rather than force.<br><br>
          It stings that I never learned about her in class. Not when her work connects to everything 
          from quantum physics to how the universe folds. Even more, it stings that she died at 40 - 
          what else might she have uncovered?<br><br>
          My math classes told their own story: maybe one or two women against thirty men. Yet somehow, 
          those women were always near the top. I don't know what that says about math, but I know what
          it says about the world. Maryam proved wonder isn't just for daydreamers - it's the sharpest tool we have.

        If you're here thinking "this guy only highlights women"—hold up. 
        Truth is, oppression doesn't care about gender, and neither do I. 
        This section's got two men and one woman because defiance isn't about
        chromosomes. It's about people who saw fucked-up systems and said "nah."<br><br>
        I won't pretend these three labels—stealth, rebellion, vision—fully capture 
        them (you'll see why the categories blur). But stick around. There's a 
        method to this, and yeah, I'm kinda proud of how these pieces fit together.<br><br>

      <p>What do I know about love? Grief? Jealousy? Like so much in this world—not enough. (Or maybe just enough to know I want to learn more.)<br><br>
        There’s something extraordinary about the way words can give shape to feelings we don’t even fully understand. Imagine being loved
        so deeply that someone had to write about it. (Or is it the other way around? Does writing about it make the love deeper?) 
        Imagine crafting sentences that cut sharper than a blade or bloom softer than a bruise. Poetry exists in a realm where language bends 
        reality—where words become weapons, yes, but not for destruction. They’re weapons of witness. A single line can pull you into a story 
        you’ve never lived, make you ache with a borrowed sorrow, or glow with secondhand joy. Maybe one day you’ll feel it for yourself. 
        (Or maybe—in retrospect—you’ll hope you never do.)<br><br>

        That’s the truth of life, isn’t it? And that’s the power of a mind with a pen: to carve the intangible into something you can hold.<br>

      <h2>My Stories</h2>
      <p>Okay, full disclosure—this is where things get a little cringey. But hey, we’ve all been there.<br>
        <br>
        Back in 2018, I was wrestling with a lot of emotions, and my genius strategy was to shut them down 
        until they… disappeared? (Spoiler: That didn’t work. Shocking, I know.)<br><br>

        Somehow, in all that chaos, I stumbled onto writing as a way to make sense of things. But I didn’t 
        write about my problems directly—instead, I wrote about the things I loved, the moments that stuck 
        with me, the thoughts that wouldn’t let go. Some of these turned into absurdly long rambles (how did 
        I even have the time?), but looking back, they mattered. They were tiny anchors in the storm.<br><br>

        And then, of course, there was him. Did I write because I’d finally found a way to process things? Or
        because I’d found a muse worth preserving? I still don’t know. But that’s a question for another poem.<br><br>

      <h2>Music and their power</h2>
      <p>
        We've reached one of my favorite parts - sharing music. This is where I get real, because music means too 
        much to me to fake it. Some people don't get that? Fine. But here's the thing: I'm about to say stuff most 
        don't know about me. If you care, great. If not? Well, it's my page anyway.<br><br>
        
        Full confession: My favorite artist is Taylor Swift (shocking). Except that's not the whole truth. 
        Before 2020, I didn't care about her - Selena Gomez was my person. But Taylor...she became something else. 
        A figment keeping memories alive. Reminiscence? Maybe.<br><br>

        That was when I realized music's power - or rather, when you made me realize it. You with your stupid 
        positive worldview, always seeing good everywhere, always wanting to do more. Cleverness I can process - 
        but that relentless kindness? Still haven't cracked that code<br><br>
        
        You taught me to actually listen - to lyrics, to moments songs drag back up. Some are straight poetry 
        (yes, even WAP - future English classes will study those metaphors, mark my words).<br><br>
        
        Let's dive into the songs that feel like borrowed memories</p>

      <h2>Think Pieces</h2>
      <p>Some cause I feel strong about, and why I care? The beauty about being human is really about having a mind to think differently than others,
      its always nice to have others agree with you, but the real magic is in those that disagree and are willing to express themselves in a manner where you 
      are able to understand the way that they think.</p>
