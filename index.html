      <h2>Books Recommendations</h2>
      <p>Not sure if anyone else will find these as fascinating as I did, but here are some books I’ve thoroughly enjoyed. 
        To keep things light (and because I get that not everyone loves a dense math book), I’ve left out the super technical 
        reads—but there’s still plenty of fun and insight here.
      </p>
      <p>To me, a book is like an invitation into someone’s mind. Writing is really about how the author feels and how they 
        choose to express those feelings. And that’s the fascinating part—trying to piece together how a person works. You can 
        learn a lot by observing how someone behaves, treats others, or even what they love and hate. But reading their thoughts?
        That’s where the real mystery unfolds.
      </p>
      <p>You get glimpses of their lessons, regrets, dreams—sometimes it even feels like they’re writing about you. Some books make 
        you nod along in sympathy; others feel like you could’ve written them yourself. And in the process, you end up learning just 
        as much about yourself as you do about the author.

      <h2>Poetry pieces</h2>
      <p>What do I know about love? Grief? Jealousy? Like so much in this world—not enough. (Or maybe just enough to know I want to learn more.)<br><br>
        There’s something extraordinary about the way words can give shape to feelings we don’t even fully understand. Imagine being loved
        so deeply that someone had to write about it. (Or is it the other way around? Does writing about it make the love deeper?) 
        Imagine crafting sentences that cut sharper than a blade or bloom softer than a bruise. Poetry exists in a realm where language bends 
        reality—where words become weapons, yes, but not for destruction. They’re weapons of witness. A single line can pull you into a story 
        you’ve never lived, make you ache with a borrowed sorrow, or glow with secondhand joy. Maybe one day you’ll feel it for yourself. 
        (Or maybe—in retrospect—you’ll hope you never do.)<br><br>

        That’s the truth of life, isn’t it? And that’s the power of a mind with a pen: to carve the intangible into something you can hold.<br>

      <h2>My Stories</h2>
      <p>Okay, full disclosure—this is where things get a little cringey. But hey, we’ve all been there.<br>
        <br>
        Back in 2018, I was wrestling with a lot of emotions, and my genius strategy was to shut them down 
        until they… disappeared? (Spoiler: That didn’t work. Shocking, I know.)<br><br>

        Somehow, in all that chaos, I stumbled onto writing as a way to make sense of things. But I didn’t 
        write about my problems directly—instead, I wrote about the things I loved, the moments that stuck 
        with me, the thoughts that wouldn’t let go. Some of these turned into absurdly long rambles (how did 
        I even have the time?), but looking back, they mattered. They were tiny anchors in the storm.<br><br>

        And then, of course, there was him. Did I write because I’d finally found a way to process things? Or
        because I’d found a muse worth preserving? I still don’t know. But that’s a question for another poem.<br><br>

      <h2>Think Pieces</h2>
      <p>Some cause I feel strong about, and why I care? The beauty about being human is really about having a mind to think differently than others,
      its always nice to have others agree with you, but the real magic is in those that disagree and are willing to express themselves in a manner where you 
      are able to understand the way that they think.</p>
