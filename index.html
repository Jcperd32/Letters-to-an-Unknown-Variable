    <h2>My Stories & Milestones</h2>
    <p>This is where we get cringy, but hopefully not too much, I have always envy the way some people are able to write the way way they feel with an imagery that you can feel,
    so long ago I decided to try it for myself about little times in my life where I have feel some type of way, or about people that have really affected me,
    i didnt really think I would ever let others read because it can be strange, but now i undertstand that these were made to be understand by two people.</p>

  <section id="think-pieces" class="content-section hidden">
    <h2>Think Pieces</h2>
    <p>Some cause I feel strong about, and why I care? The beauty about being human is really about having a mind to think differently than others,
    its always nice to have others agree with you, but the real magic is in those that disagree and are willing to express themselves in a manner where you 
    are able to understand the way that they think.</p>
